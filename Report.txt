                  CLIP MODEL IMPLEMENTATION & PROMPT ENGINEERING REPORT
================================================================================

PROJECT SETUP
=============
- Cloned official CLIP GitHub repository
- Created Python virtual environment (clip_env)
- Installed required dependencies (torch, torchvision, clip, scikit-learn, etc.)
- All implementation done in clip.ipynb


WORKFLOW & IMPLEMENTATION
==========================

Step 1: CLIP Setup & Initial Validation
   - Loaded pre-trained ViT-B/32 CLIP model
   - Tested on custom image (CLIP.png) with 3 candidate labels: ["a diagram", "a dog", "a cat"]
   - Predicted probabilities: [99.27%, 0.42%, 0.30%] (correctly identified as diagram)
   - Validated model's image-text alignment capability

Step 2: Zero-Shot Classification on Sample Images
   - Tested on 4 CIFAR-10 images with indices: [3637, 1000, 5000, 85]
   - Visualized images with predicted vs actual labels (4-panel grid)
   - Displayed top-10 predictions for each image with confidence scores
   - Demonstrated both successful and failed predictions
   - Example: Bird (ID: 3637) misclassified as cat (79.23%) vs bird (3.71%)

Step 3: Linear Probe on Full CIFAR-10
   - Extracted frozen CLIP features from 50,000 training images
   - Extracted frozen CLIP features from 10,000 test images
   - Trained logistic regression classifier (C=0.316, max_iter=100)
   - Test Accuracy: 95.00%
   - Shows CLIP features are excellent for downstream classification

Step 4: Zero-Shot on Full CIFAR-10
   - Evaluated on all 10,000 test images without any training
   - Computed text features for all 10 CIFAR-10 classes
   - Matched image-text similarity for each test sample
   - Test Accuracy: 88.80%
   - Demonstrates strong transfer capability even without training
   - Gap from linear probe: Only 6.2%

Step 5: Prompt Engineering Analysis
   - Tested 2 prompt templates:
     * Simple: "a {}"
     * Descriptive: "a photo of a {}"
   - Tested 3 class name variations:
     * Original (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, ...)
     * Lowercase (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, ...)
     * Plural (airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, ...)
   - Sample size: 200 images (80x speedup optimization)
   - Result: Descriptive prompts outperformed simple templates
   - Finding: "a photo of a {}" achieved higher accuracy than "a {}"


Some modifications 
=================
- Reduced logistic regression iterations: 1000 → 100 (10x faster)
- Sample size for prompt engineering: 200 images 


==========
This project successfully demonstrated CLIP's effectiveness for zero-shot and 
linear probe classification. Key findings:
• Descriptive prompts with specific attributes improve accuracy as it provides more context
