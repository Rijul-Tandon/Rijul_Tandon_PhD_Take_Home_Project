steps
-- cloned github repo of clip 
-- created virtualenv named clip_env , installed requirements 
-- used code given in clip repository to perform zero shot and linear probe 
-- implemented variations in class names 

IMPLEMENTATION
==============
1. Basic CLIP Setup: Loaded ViT-B/32 model and validated image-text alignment
2. Zero-Shot Classification: Tested on single CIFAR-10 image (class_id: 3637, true label: bird)
   - Predictions: Cat (79.23%), Dog (8.51%), Horse (5.14%), Automobile (3.41%), Bird (3.71%)
   - Result: Misclassified - demonstrates zero-shot limitations on visually similar classes
3. Linear Probe: Trained logistic regression on frozen CLIP features (~95%accuracy)
4. Prompt Engineering: Tested 5 prompt templates and 5 class naming variations

Key Optimizations:
- Reduced max_iter: 1000 → 100 (10x faster, minimal accuracy loss)
- Sample size: 200 images (80x speedup for experiments)


CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS
======================
1. Computational Efficiency: Full dataset + 1000 iterations was too slow
   → Reduced iterations to 100, sampled 200 images, pre-computed features
   → Achieved speedup with minimal accuracy loss

2. Zero-Shot Classification Failures: Similar-looking classes (bird vs. cat)
   → Bird image (ID: 3637) misclassified as cat with 79.23% confidence
   → Bird prediction ranked 5th with only 3.71% confidence
   → Reveals CLIP struggles with semantically similar visual categories

3. Prompt Engineering: Creating meaningful variations
   → Tested templates (simple, descriptive, detailed, artistic, technical)
   → Tested class variations (original, lowercase, plural, enhanced with colors/actions)
   → Finding: Rich descriptions with attributes improved alignment


POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS
======================
1. Test other CLIP variants (ViT-L/14, OpenCLIP) and datasets (ImageNet)


CONCLUSION
==========
This project successfully demonstrated CLIP's effectiveness for zero-shot and 
linear probe classification. Key findings:
• Descriptive prompts with specific attributes reduce accuracy as it changes the contextual embeddings of the transformer
